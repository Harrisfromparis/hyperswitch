# AuthenticationType

Specifies the type of cardholder authentication to be applied for a payment.  - `ThreeDs`: Requests 3D Secure (3DS) authentication. If the card is enrolled, 3DS authentication will be activated, potentially shifting chargeback liability to the issuer. - `NoThreeDs`: Indicates that 3D Secure authentication should not be performed. The liability for chargebacks typically remains with the merchant. This is often the default if not specified.  Note: The actual authentication behavior can also be influenced by merchant configuration and specific connector defaults. Some connectors might still enforce 3DS or bypass it regardless of this parameter.

## Enum

* `THREE_DS` (value: `'three_ds'`)

* `NO_THREE_DS` (value: `'no_three_ds'`)
